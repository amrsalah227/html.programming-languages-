    <h2><strong>programming languages and code definition </strong></h2> 
A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce a various kinds of output . Programming language are used in computer programming to implement . And the code is pretty much like writing a paragraph of instruction or creating a to-do list to computers . Unlike us humans , the to-do list and instruction you write for the computer has to be extremely detailed and written in some logic . 
with a long history in the field of computer science , Basic programming has been used to simplify communication between the programmer and the computer . It was developed in 1963 as teaching language at Dartmouth by John G.Kemeny and Thomas E.Kurtz and has since been widely imitated and altered . we should learn Basic programming because it Easy to learn , Enhanced problem solving skills , transferable skills across almost any industry , Opportunities for invention and innovation , internationally diverse network , and career opportunity and flexibility .
        <h2><strong>The uses of programming language : </strong></h2>
    <h2><strong> web development </strong></h2>
   if we are interested in building websites there are two intertwining parts to look into . First ,there's front-end development , which is the part of web development that creates the application that runs on your browser and adjusts the styling , the colors , the interactions . the other part for creating websites is back-end development , which is related to the server , the computer that runs the website software and servers it to the world .
     <h2><strong>  Game development </strong></h2>
     Game development is one of the most interesting tracks there is , many developers enjoy it and there are developers who develop games just for having fun .
    <h2><strong>  Mobile Development </strong></h2>
     Mobile Development , creating mobile application is a little tricky , as there is more than one operating system for mobiles and the different operating system would require different language for these applications .
        <h2><strong>  who uses programming languages ? </strong></h2>
    there are many organisation , professions and industries use programming language in information technolngy and engineering professional services and design . major organization like Google , Printerest , Instagram , youTube ,...etc. Specializations and industries use programming language in web and internet development (framworks , micro-framworks and advanced content management systems ) ;scientific and numeric computing ; desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIS) .
